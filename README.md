# PHY-220 Final Project
Included here is my final project for the PHY-220 course at W&J College. A range of topics were provided that students were able to select from and work on throughout the remaining 3 weeks of the semester. All topics were meant to be open ended in order for students to display their application of the Pyhton knowledge being developed both in the course and skills developed outside of the classroom.

The topic chosen for this project was to analyze CO2 emissions vs. GDP, GDP per capita, and population and determine which quantitiy correlated the most with emissions. As many countries as possible were used for this analysis. 

An initial data set for CO2 emissions was provided by the instructor and the remaining data sets were taken from the World Bank. Because of this, the data for emissions compared to the other data sets featured a different range of years and countries. Pandas was used extensively and almost primarily in this analysis as a result. Other libraries used were MatPlotLib, NumPy, and SciPy.
